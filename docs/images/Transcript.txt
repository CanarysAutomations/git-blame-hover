While working in large codebases, one common question developers ask is —
Who changed this line of code, and why?
Traditionally, we switch to terminal or run git blame, which breaks the flow.
Let me show you how Git Blame Hover, a VS Code extension, solves this instantly — right inside the editor

Here, I’m simply hovering over a line of code.
And instantly, I get git blame information — without clicking anything.

It shows:

Author name

Commit date

Commit message

Commit hash

And even the platform, like Azure Repos or GitHub

All this appears as a clean tooltip, right where I’m coding

What makes this extension powerful is that it’s not just informational — it’s interactive.

From this hover itself, I can:

Copy the commit hash

View full commit details

Open file history

Or check author statistics

No context switching. No terminal. Just hover and act.

When I click File History, the extension shows a chronological list of commits that modified this file.

I can see:

Commit IDs

Authors

Dates

And commit messages

This helps me understand how the file evolved over time — perfect for debugging or reviews

Next, let’s look at Author Stats.

Here, the extension summarizes:

Total commits per author

Total line additions and deletions

Historical contribution activity

This is extremely useful to understand ownership, knowledge areas, and who to reach out to for questions.
